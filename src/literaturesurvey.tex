\section{Literature survey}

This study aims to research and develop a self-organized distributed
data storage network. Unlike the Freenet project \cite{freenet}, which
has a strong focus on anonymous and censorship resistant information
distribution, we are focusing on continuous availability of each user's
data uploaded to the network. By-definition only the original user
or a predefined third party should be able to access the user's data
in our network. We are going to utilize the BitTorrent \cite{bittorrent-ma}
p2p file sharing protocol for data transfer. 


Distributed peer-to-peer data storage networks have a great potential and have
been widely used since the beginning of 21st century
\cite{chord-01}.

Freenet is a distributed, Internet-wide peer-to-peer overlay network de-
signed to allow anonymized and censorship resistant publication and
distribution of information \cite{dark-freenet}.
