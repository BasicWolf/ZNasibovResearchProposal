\section{The problem statement}

As discussed in introduction, storing the data in cloud services
can be very convenient for the end user, but it cannot be considered
secure. If at any point the service has an access to non-encrypted
user's data there is a chance that a 3d party, or the service itself
may intercept it for malicious actions.

One possible solution would encrypting the data prior to sending it
to a cloud service. 

In this study we are aiming to research, prototype and build a volunteer
p2p storage network, with the focus on the following basic properties
and challenges to solve:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data security} - all the user's data stored in the network is
  accessible by the user or a party with whom a user is sharing an abstract
  ``secret'' only.
\item \textbf{Scalability} - a network can be established in various
  scales: from two-devices personal network up to an Internet-wide storage
  system.
\item \textbf{Self-organization} - a network is self-organized in such
  fashion that the users data is at least readable in case of it's spontaneous
  degradation, like availability of peers, the contributed storage size
  decrease, network lags and other failures.
\item \textbf{Decentralization} - a network is completely decentralized,
  with no key servers, so that there is no ``off'' button which shuts the
  whole network down.
\item \textbf{Usability} - the software should be easy and intuitive to
  use. Ideally the network client should be ready to use after a  simple
  ``setup'' with a minimum set of questions to the user.
\item \textbf{Fairness} - the amount of the network resources available
  to each user correlates with his or her contribution.
\end{itemize}


* Why do we focus on p2p storage?
* What do we try to achieve?

* Fairness:
  * resource management
  * proof of storage and proof of transfer
  * how long the data may remain? 
* Self-organization:
  * how the nodes should be grouped? 
  * how the data should replicated?
  * node types and behaviour: mobile, stationary PC,
* Decentralization:
  * Defense against known generic attacks on p2p networks.
* Usability:
  * Access through web applications, i.e. browser?
  * Access on mobile platforms?
